# GenAI & Insurance: Multi-Document Summarization Demo

This repository contains a hands-on demo of how Generative AI and Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) can be used to simplify the understanding of complex insurance product documentation.

## 📋 Project Overview

The demo shows how to:

- Load and segment real insurance documents.
- Apply prompt-based summarization using the **Map-Reduce** strategy.
- Extract financial and contractual information from each section.

## 🔗 Dependencies

You need to install some dependencies to use all the needed libraries. You can install them directly from the notebook:

```python
# Install dependencies
%pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🔑 Configuration

You need an OpenAI API Key to run the summarization.

You can define the key directly in your notebook:

```python
# Load OpenAI API key
# Instructions: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key
open_api_key = "Insert you OpenAI API key here"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = open_api_key
```
